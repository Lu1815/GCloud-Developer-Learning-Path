  - High responsiveness for dynamic translation.
  - Translates text from a source language to a target language.
- **Use Case Example**:
  - Real-time translation for websites and applications.

### 5. Cloud Natural Language API
- **Functionality**: Extracts information from text.
- **Features**:
  - **Entity Recognition**: Identifies entities mentioned in text.
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Understands sentiment in social media posts or customer conversations.
  - **Syntax Analysis**: Parses the structure of text.
  - **Content Classification**: Categorizes content into predefined categories.
- **Use Case Example**:
  - Understanding sentiment about products on social media.

### 6. Video Intelligence API
- **Functionality**: Searches video files to extract and label entities.
- **Features**:
  - Annotates videos at the shot, frame, or video level.
  - Identifies key entities and timestamps within videos.
- **Use Case Example**:
  - Annotating videos stored in Cloud Storage to identify when specific entities appear.

### 7. AutoML on Vertex AI
- **Functionality**: Enables users with limited ML expertise to train high-quality custom models.
- **Features**:
  - Supports training models on images, tabular data, text, or videos.
  - No code required for training models.
- **Use Case Example**:
  - Training custom ML models specific to business needs using a user-friendly interface.

### 8. Custom ML Models
- **Frameworks**: Use TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Vertex AI to build and train custom ML models.
- **Use Case Example**:
  - Developing bespoke ML models for specialized tasks using custom datasets.

## Example: Using Vision API
1. **Process an Image**:
   - Store the image in Cloud Storage.
   - Invoke the REST API with a JSON request.
   - Receive a JSON response with attributes describing the image.

2. **Example Request and Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "requests": [
       {
         "image": {
           "source": {
             "gcsImageUri": "gs://bucket_name/image.jpg"
           }
         },
         "features": [
           {
             "type": "LABEL_DETECTION"
           }
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "labelAnnotations": [
       {
         "description": "Sphinx",
         "score": 0.95
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Google Use Case Example
- **Occupancy Detection**:
  - Googleâ€™s conference room systems use motion detection with VC cameras.
  - Sends Pub/Sub notifications every 30 seconds about motion detection.
  - Determines room occupancy based on motion detection within specific time frames.

## Conclusion
Pre-trained ML models from Google Cloud can add significant value to your applications by enabling advanced functionalities such as image and speech recognition, language translation, sentiment analysis, and video intelligence. These models are easy to integrate via REST APIs, making powerful ML capabilities accessible without requiring deep technical knowledge.
