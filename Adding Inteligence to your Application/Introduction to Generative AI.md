# Introduction to Generative AI

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that creates new content based on what it has learned from existing content. This process involves training a statistical model on large datasets to generate new and relevant outputs based on given inputs, known as prompts.

### How Does Generative AI Work?
- **Training**: The AI learns from a massive amount of existing content such as text, images, and audio.
- **Foundation Model**: The training process results in the creation of a foundation model.
- **Prompt and Response**: You provide an input (prompt) to the model, and it predicts and generates an expected response.

### Types of Foundation Models
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Trained on text data to perform tasks like content extraction or document summarization.
- **Other Models**: Trained on various types of data, such as images or programming code.

## Differences Between Generative AI and Traditional Programming

### Traditional Programming
- **Rule-Based**: Requires specifying rules for the machine to follow.
- **Example**: Defining attributes of a cat explicitly (e.g., legs, ears, fur).

### Machine Learning with Neural Networks
- **Pattern Recognition**: Feeds data and answers to the machine, allowing it to discover rules.
- **Narrow Focus**: Typically solves specific tasks within a narrow field.

### Generative AI
- **Multimodal Data**: Uses a huge amount of diverse data to learn concepts.
- **Foundation Models**: Develops models like LLMs to solve general problems and generate new content.

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

### Characteristics
- **Large Datasets**: Trained on enormous datasets, sometimes at the petabyte scale.
- **Parameters**: Models have billions or even trillions of parameters, representing the knowledge learned during training.
- **General-Purpose**: Can solve common problems due to the commonality in human language.
- **Pre-Trained and Fine-Tuned**: Initially pre-trained on a large dataset, then fine-tuned for specific purposes using smaller datasets.

## Potential Use Cases of Generative AI

### Content Creation
- **Generate Stories or Poems**: Based on user prompts.
- **Image Improvement**: Enhances images based on instructions.

### Knowledge Summarization
- **Summarize Media**: Automatically summarizes video, audio, and text content.
- **Generate Q&A**: Produces questions and answers based on the content.

### Search and Discovery
- **Document Search**: Finds documents based on content.
- **Product Discovery**: Identifies products based on desired features.

### Workflow Automation
- **Contract Extraction and Labeling**: Automates the extraction and labeling of contracts.
- **Feedback Classification**: Classifies feedback and creates support tickets.

## Impact on Application Development

### AI-Powered Coding Assistant
Generative AI can revolutionize application development with features like:
- **Code Generation**: Generates code from natural language descriptions.
- **Unit Tests**: Automatically generates unit tests for code.
- **Code Optimization**: Optimizes existing code.
- **Documentation**: Adds comments or generates release notes based on code changes.
- **Code Explanation**: Explains the function and workings of code.
- **Bug Fixing**: Identifies and fixes bugs in code.
- **Code Completion**: Suggests code to complete lines or entire functions.
- **Code Translation**: Translates code between programming languages while adhering to conventions.

### Tools and APIs
- **Vertex AI Codey APIs**: Assist with code generation, code chat, and code completion.
- **Gemini**: Provides an AI assistant to help write code faster and more efficiently.

Generative AI offers powerful capabilities to enhance applications, automate workflows, and assist developers, making it a transformative technology in the field of artificial intelligence.
