  - **Object Size**: Each object can be up to 5 TB.
  - **Built for**: Availability, durability, scalability, and consistency.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Hosting static websites.
  - Storing images, videos, and other unstructured data.
  - Archiving data for long-term storage.

### 2. Firestore
- **Overview**: A fast, fully managed, serverless NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Strong Consistency**: Ensures data integrity across all clients.
  - **Hierarchical Data Model**: Uses collections and documents, supporting nested objects and subcollections.
  - **Real-Time Updates**: Provides real-time synchronization and offline capabilities.
  - **Scalability**: Automatically scales based on the application's load.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Mobile and web applications requiring flexible data storage.
  - Applications with external user accounts.
  - Real-time collaborative applications.

### 3. Cloud Bigtable
- **Overview**: A high-performance NoSQL database service designed for large analytical and operational workloads.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Scalability**: Can scale to billions of rows and thousands of columns.
  - **High Throughput**: Provides fast key-value lookups and supports consistent sub-10ms latency.
  - **Integration**: Supports the HBase API.
  - **Seamless Scaling**: Allows immediate changes to the deployment configuration without downtime.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Storing user behavior data.
  - Performing analytical operations like MapReduce.
  - Handling large amounts of single-keyed data.

### 4. Cloud SQL
- **Overview**: A managed relational database service supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Managed Service**: Google manages replication, failover, and backups.
  - **Replication and Failover**: Supports read replicas and automatic failover for high availability.
  - **Secure Access**: Uses Cloud SQL Auth Proxy for secure connections without configuring IP addresses or SSL certificates.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Web frameworks and applications requiring structured data.
  - Online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads.
  - Applications using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server with minimal refactoring for cloud migration.

### 5. AlloyDB
- **Overview**: A fully managed, high-performance PostgreSQL database service that separates compute and storage for scalability.
- **Key Features**:
  - **High Performance**: Up to 4 times faster than standard PostgreSQL for transactional workloads.
  - **Columnar Engine**: Provides 100 times faster performance for analytical queries.
  - **Full Compatibility**: Maintains PostgreSQL compatibility with high availability and automatic scaling.
  - **Secure Access**: Uses AlloyDB Auth Proxy similar to Cloud SQL Auth Proxy.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Applications requiring high performance and PostgreSQL compatibility.
  - Hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) workloads.

### 6. Cloud Spanner
- **Overview**: A fully managed relational database service offering strong consistency and horizontal scalability.
- **Key Features**:
  - **High Availability**: Provides automatic, synchronous replication and supports multi-region replication with a 99.999% SLA.
  - **Designed For**: Mission-critical online transactional processing (OLTP) applications.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Applications with relational, structured, and semi-structured data.
  - Applications requiring high availability and strong consistency.
  - Transactional reads and writes.
