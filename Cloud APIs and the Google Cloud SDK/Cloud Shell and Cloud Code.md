# Cloud Shell and Cloud Code

## Introduction
This guide covers the functionalities and benefits of Google Cloud Shell and Cloud Code, essential tools for cloud-based development and management of Google Cloud resources.

## Cloud Shell

### Overview
- **What is Cloud Shell?**
  - Cloud Shell is a free, browser-based command-line tool accessible from the Google Cloud Console.
  - It provides a temporary virtual machine instance with 5 GB of persistent disk storage.

### Key Features
1. **Virtual Machine**:
   - When you start Cloud Shell, it provisions a Compute Engine virtual machine running a Debian-based Linux operating system.
   - Instances are provisioned on a per-user, per-session basis and persist only while the session is active.
   - Instances terminate after an hour of inactivity but retain the persistent disk used with previous instances.

2. **Pre-installed Google Cloud SDK**:
   - Cloud Shell includes the Google Cloud SDK with built-in authorization to your Google Cloud projects and resources.
   - The SDK includes various command-line tools such as `gcloud`, `gsutil`, and `bq`.

3. **Built-in Code Editor**:
   - Cloud Shell features a built-in code editor based on Theia, enabling you to browse directories and view/edit files within your VM.

## Cloud Code

### Overview
- **What is Cloud Code?**
  - Cloud Code is a set of IDE plugins designed to streamline the development, deployment, and debugging of cloud applications for Google Cloud.
  - It is available for Cloud Shell Editor, Visual Studio Code, and JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, PyCharm).

### Key Features
1. **Development Environment Integration**:
   - Cloud Code integrates seamlessly with popular IDEs, making it easier to develop cloud applications.
   - It simplifies common workflows by merging complex tasks into a user-friendly interface within the IDE.

2. **Secret Manager Integration**:
   - Cloud Code integrates with Secret Manager for securely storing and managing passwords, keys, certificates, and other sensitive data within the IDE.

3. **Cloud APIs Management**:
   - Manage Cloud APIs directly from the IDE.
   - Browse available Cloud APIs, view client library documentation, and find/copy code samples.

4. **Kubernetes Development**:
   - Cloud Code for Kubernetes allows you to develop Kubernetes applications in your IDE.
   - You can run and debug applications in a local cluster or on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).
   - Kubernetes Explorer provides visualization and management of Kubernetes resources within the IDE.
   - YAML authoring assistance simplifies creating/editing Kubernetes configuration files with autocomplete and inline documentation.

5. **Cloud Run Integration**:
   - Develop Cloud Run services using Cloud Code and run/debug them locally with the Cloud Run Emulator.
   - Deploy services directly from the IDE and manage them using Cloud Run Explorer.

### Example Commands and Usage
1. **Managing Cloud Shell**:
   - **Start Cloud Shell**: Open Cloud Shell from the Google Cloud Console.
   - **Use gcloud CLI**: Perform tasks such as listing Compute Engine instances with `gcloud compute instances list`.

2. **Installing and Managing Emulators**:
   - Install local emulators for Google Cloud services using `gcloud beta emulators`.
   - Set environment variables to connect Cloud Client Libraries to local emulators instead of Google Cloud services.
   - Available emulators include Bigtable, Datastore, Firestore, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Spanner.

## Cloud Workstations

### Overview
- **What are Cloud Workstations?**
  - Cloud Workstations provide fully managed, secure cloud-based development environments.
  - They allow developers to access fast and consistent environments anytime, anywhere, using a browser, SSH, or a local IDE.

### Key Features
1. **Reproducible Environments**:
   - IT admins can create workstation configurations that specify development environments in a reproducible way.
   - Developers can access these environments regardless of their location, computer type, or network.

2. **Integration with Code Editors**:
   - Supports any code editors and applications that can run in a container.
   - Environments run on ephemeral Compute Engine VMs, which can be started/stopped on demand or when idle to save costs.

3. **Security**:
   - The IDE runs on customer-owned VMs and persistent disks inside the customer VPC, ensuring the security of developer machines and code.

## Conclusion
Cloud Shell and Cloud Code are powerful tools that enhance the development and management of Google Cloud resources. By leveraging these tools, developers can streamline their workflows, ensure security, and efficiently manage cloud applications.
