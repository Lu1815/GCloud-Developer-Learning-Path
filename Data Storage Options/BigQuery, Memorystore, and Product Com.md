## Google Cloud Storage Options at a Glance

### Choosing the Right Storage Option

#### Considerations
1. **Read/Write Latency**: Determine the acceptable latency for your applicationâ€™s needs.
2. **Data Size**: Consider the typical size of your data.
3. **Storage Type**: Choose between object storage, document storage, key-value storage, and relational storage based on the data model.

#### Storage Products and Ideal Use Cases

1. **Cloud Storage**:
   - **Ideal For**: Storing large binary objects like images, videos, and backups.
   - **Not Ideal For**: Use cases requiring complex queries or transactions.

2. **Firestore**:
   - **Ideal For**: Mobile and web applications needing real-time updates and offline capabilities.
   - **Not Ideal For**: Highly complex relational data or large-scale analytical queries.

3. **Cloud Bigtable**:
   - **Ideal For**: High-throughput applications like user behavior tracking and time-series data.
   - **Not Ideal For**: Applications requiring multi-row transactions or complex query capabilities.

4. **Cloud SQL**:
   - **Ideal For**: Structured data, web frameworks, and OLTP workloads.
   - **Not Ideal For**: Extremely large datasets requiring horizontal scaling.

5. **AlloyDB**:
   - **Ideal For**: High-performance applications needing PostgreSQL compatibility and hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP).
