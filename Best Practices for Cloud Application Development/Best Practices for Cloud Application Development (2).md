# Best Practices for Cloud Application Development (2)

## Introduction
This guide covers key best practices for cloud application development, focusing on improving performance, security, scalability, and operational efficiency.

## Caching for Improved Performance
- **Purpose of Caching**: Caching content can significantly improve application performance and reduce network latency.
- **Cache Frequently Accessed Data**: Cache data that is accessed frequently or is computationally intensive to calculate each time.
- **Cache Workflow**:
  1. **Check Cache First**: When a user requests data, the application component should check the cache.
  2. **Return Cached Data**: If data exists in the cache, return the cached data.
  3. **Retrieve and Cache**: If data is not in the cache or has expired, retrieve it from backend sources, recompute results, and update the cache.
- **Tools for Caching**:
  - **Memorystore**: Google Cloud's fully managed in-memory service for caching using Redis or Memcached.
  - **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Use Cloud CDN to cache web content and serve it closer to users via Google's global edge network. Static content can be served from Cloud Storage buckets, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, or Compute Engine virtual machine instance groups.

## API Gateways
- **Function of API Gateways**: Implement API gateways to make backend functionality available to consumer applications.
- **Platform**: Apigee is a platform for developing and managing APIs.
- **Benefits of Apigee**: Acts as a facade for backend service APIs, providing security, rate limiting, quotas, analytics, and more.
- **Legacy Applications**: For legacy applications that cannot be refactored, implement APIs to allow modern applications to communicate with them.

## Identity Management
- **Delegating Identity Management**: Minimize effort for user administration by delegating identity management.
- **External Providers**: Delegate user authentication to Google or other providers like Facebook or GitHub.
- **Identity Platform**: Provides a customizable authentication service for user sign-up and sign-in. Supports multiple authentication methods, including email/password, SAML, OpenID Connect, and multi-factor authentication.
- **Firebase Authentication**: Offers backend services, SDKs, and UI libraries for authenticating users to your app.
- **Federated Identity Management**: Avoid implementing and securing proprietary solutions by using federated identity management.

## Logging as Event Streams
- **Continuous Event Streams**: Treat logs as continuous streams of events occurring as long as the application is running.
- **Log Management**: Write logs to an event stream (stdout) rather than managing log files in your application. Let the infrastructure collate events for analysis and storage.
- **Logs-Based Metrics**: Set up metrics and trace requests across services using logs.
- **Serverless Compute**: Logging to stdout works well for serverless compute options like Cloud Run and Cloud Functions.
- **Google Cloud Operations Suite**: Use this suite to set up error reporting, logging, logs-based metrics, and monitor applications in a multi-cloud environment.

## DevOps and Automation
- **Strong DevOps Model**: Implement a robust DevOps model with CI/CD pipelines for automation.
- **Benefits of Automation**: Increases release velocity and reliability, allowing incremental testing and rollouts to reduce risks and quickly debug issues.
- **CI/CD Explained**:
  - **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers commit code changes to a shared branch, triggering builds and automated testing.
  - **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Validated code is stored in a repository, ready for deployment by the operations team.
  - **Continuous Deployment**: Takes continuous delivery further by automatically deploying validated changes to production, only blocked by failed tests.
- **Google Cloud CI/CD**: Use Cloud Build to detect repository commits, trigger builds, and run tests. Store artifacts in Artifact Registry and use Cloud Deploy for automated deployment.
- **Deployment Strategies**: Perform blue-green deployments or canary testing to ensure new builds do not negatively impact most users.

## Migration Strategies
- **Strangler Pattern**: Use this pattern when rearchitecting or migrating large applications.
  - **Incremental Replacement**: Replace smaller components of the legacy application with new services, gradually phasing out the old system.
  - **Strangler Facade**: A facade receives requests and directs them to either the old application or new services, minimizing risks.
- **Analogy**: Named after strangler vines, which gradually envelop and replace trees.

## Conclusion
By following these best practices for cloud application development, you will ensure your applications are performant, scalable, secure, and operationally efficient, setting them up for long-term success.
