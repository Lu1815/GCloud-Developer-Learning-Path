### What Are Microservices?

#### Traditional Application Design:
- **Monolithic Applications:**
  - Early enterprise applications were developed as large, self-contained units.
  - These monoliths included the user interface, business logic, and data access code.
  - Data was persisted in a large, relational database.
  - The applications handled many tasks, making the codebase complex.
  - Tight coupling of code within a single application made maintenance difficult, often introducing new bugs when fixing existing ones.

#### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):
- **Introduction:**
  - SOA was introduced to solve the challenges of monolithic applications.
  - It focuses on building reusable software components called services, each executing a discrete business function.
  - Communication between services was implemented using messaging over defined service interfaces.

- **Implementation:**
  - SOA was typically implemented at an enterprise level.
  - Organizations mapped business activities into services and mandated interoperability and discoverability standards.
  - Services were smaller and more loosely coupled than in monolithic applications, often leading to smaller development teams focused on specific services.

- **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB):**
  - Messages between services were handled by a messaging middleware component called the ESB.
  - The ESB managed connectivity, security, message routing, and transformation, enabling application integration even outside the organization.
  - However, ESB integrations often became bottlenecks, as changes in one application could destabilize others, and updates required significant testing.

#### Microservices Architecture:
- **Introduction:**
  - Microservices are a decentralized approach to decomposing applications into services.
  - Each microservice is a separate entity with limited scope, often handling a specific business domain (e.g., orders, products, reviews) and having its own database.

- **Characteristics:**
  - Microservices specify an interface, typically an API, used by other services for operations.
  - This separation leads to loose coupling between services, making them easier to maintain, update, and deploy.

- **Designing Microservices:**
  - Starting with microservices can be challenging, especially in defining service boundaries.
  - If expertise in the problem domain is lacking, it might be difficult to decide on the separate services to create.
  - Starting with a monolithic application and migrating to microservices later can be a practical approach as you gain more experience with the problem domain.

- **Benefits:**
  - Microservices are easier to deliver in an agile fashion compared to monoliths.
  - They allow for quick release changes to services, making them suitable for fast-paced development environments.
  - Microservices facilitate team growth by allowing new members to focus on smaller parts of the application rather than learning a large monolithic codebase.
  - They provide natural service boundaries, enabling smaller teams with reduced scope.

- **Migrating to Microservices:**
  - When starting with a monolith, designing the application to be modular can make it easier to migrate to microservices in the future.

#### Summary:
Microservices architecture represents a shift from traditional monolithic and SOA designs, providing a decentralized approach to building applications with smaller, loosely coupled services. This architecture allows for easier maintenance, faster updates, and more manageable team structures, making it an ideal choice for modern, agile development environments. However, it requires careful planning and expertise in defining service boundaries to maximize its benefits.
